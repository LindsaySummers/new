### 2018 February/March Application

![EssayQuestions]    
  
## **Question #1: *Why do you want join Ada Developers Academy? Why are you interested in programming? Tell us about your journey thus far to learn about and confirm your interest in programming.***  
  
I have always been interested in programming. I remember when AOL first came out (I was in middle school), there were AOL profiles – a section where one could type a bit about oneself so that others could learn about the person. I remember thinking that plain text was boring, so I researched if there was a way to make it more interesting. Sure enough, I found myself “coding” (what I thought was coding) for bold, underlined, italicized text, headers, and colors! I was in heaven! I absolutely LOVED making my AOL profile truly reflect my personality.  

I consider myself to be a very logical, systematic, and organized person, so I believe that my brain has always been on the same wave-length as one who is a programmer.  

When I was in college, I naturally found myself studying math. I love math because it is very logical and systematic, yet there is an artistic and very beautiful side to mathematics as well. Problems can be approached, and solved, in many different ways and styles; this only deepened my love problem solving. I loved tackling new problems each day and brainstorming and collaborating with my colleagues.
Nowadays, I use MS Excel for just about everything in my everyday life, because I love how organized and powerful it is.  

What I have done recently to expose myself to programming is that I’ve been practicing on Code.org and Scratch.mit.edu, watched YouTube tutorials, and have tried the Jump Start curriculum.

## **Question #2: *If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? How do you see yourself impacting the technology field?***  
  
I usually have crazy ideas for new apps and always think about how businesses can improve. On a regular basis, I say to friends “They (whichever establishment we’re in) should have on their website a place where users could _(blank)_ and then that data will _(blank)_ and the customers can _(blank)_!” My friends usually agree, So, for fun, I try to make something close to what I was dreaming about via embedding Google Forms and Google Sheets - It does the job, but I know if I knew how to program, I could make my amazing visions a reality!  
  
A little over two years ago, my partner had the idea for his company to sponsor the first free wedding in Seattle’s Pride Parade. He was in charge of all the logistics and was constantly bouncing ideas off of me about “How should applicants apply? How should we determine a winner?” etc. I had a lot of ideas about submitting videos to a website and having the general public vote, but I did not know how to make a website like that. We ended up just having the applicants email their videos and then the company chose one. I really loved helping with this project - it’s times like that when I wish I knew more about programming so I could help even more!  
  
So, in 5 years, I see myself knowing a lot more about programming, and helping with projects that make Seattle so unique.

## **Question #3: *Read [Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement]. How will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?***  
  
We need to celebrate difference and embrace it.  
  
I am accepting and loving of everyone and I will always stand by that – I do not back down when it comes to topics I strongly believe in.  
  
Years ago, two of my friends and I were hanging out and one friend called the other a derogatory name – they both laughed, yet I didn’t even crack a smile. Long story short, I gave my friend a piece of my mind, stood my ground, and then left because I felt like I was no longer in a safe space with accepting people.  
  
A few days later, they told me they are both gay (each other’s partners) – that they aren’t just roommates, but an actual couple. They were 100% serious and said it was amazing how I stood up to them, FOR them (without even knowing). They told me how they had done that “test” to others before and people just uncomfortably laugh along, but no one has the audacity to actually take a stand. To this day, they praise me for how I fought for what I truly believe in, even when I thought no one listening.  
  
I will contribute to the Ada community in the same way I contribute the diversity and inclusivity already, outside of Ada, in my everyday life: by being accepting and loving of everyone, and letting no one, no matter who they are, destroy the safe environment around me.

## **Question #4: *Tell us about a time you made a mistake. What did you learn? What would you do differently?***  

Honestly, I make mistakes every day of my life and I really do believe that I learn something from all of them.  

If I had to narrow down a mistake that I’ve made professionally, I would say the biggest one would be trying to accomplish a huge company project on my own without asking for the help from coworkers.  
  
I’m a bit of a perfectionist, so when an important assignment came up at my job, I volunteered and naturally wanted to do each and every part of the assignment on my own so that I could ensure it was done perfectly. I was researching, designing, scheduling, planning, and putting it all together on my own – that was the first half of the mistake. The second half of the mistake was that when my boss asked me if I needed help and additional people on my team, I said no and that I was ok working on it myself.  
  
I did complete the project and everyone loved it. In fact, I think it’s still used today as a model in that company for future projects. However, I did learn a valuable lesson after that situation: it is more than ok to ask for help! Since then, I have managed projects and have learned how to assign smaller parts of the project to the team members (depending on their skills and talents) so that the overall project isn’t overwhelming to piece together for the project manager (me).

## **Question #5: *(ONLY FOR REAPPLICANTS) What has changed since your last application? Please share any relevant work, study, or personal experiences.***  
  
Since the last Ada application, I've been really trying to immerse myself into programming tutorials as well as the developer community.

Learning to program, I’ve been working on [Code Academy], [Khan Academy], Ada’s Jumpstart curriculum, [Code.org], [Scratch.mit.edu], YouTube tutorials, as well as practicing with writing macros in MS Excel.

The YouTube tutorials, Khan Academy, and Ada’s Jumpstart curriculum has been a lot more difficult, so I’ve been focusing most of my time there – it’s amazing how in depth those lessons get!

As a break for my brain (yet still trying to be active and learn) I’ve been programming art projects on Code.org which spiral forever when you run the program (like “spin art” from when I was a kid – with a modern techy twist)! On Scratch.mit.edu, I’ve really been enjoying making my own video games.

When I’m not near a computer, I’ve been immersing myself into the developer community by reaching out to girls on Facebook (as well as other social platforms) in order to hang out and make like-minded friends. I’ve been snowboarding with my new friends a bunch of times this season and I love that we can hang out on top of a mountain and still talk about computers and programming. I’ve met a lot of really supportive people who have given me suggestions and little “homework assignments,” pointers, and what to try next. It’s been really amazing and I’m so grateful for all the feedback and inspiration they have given me!
